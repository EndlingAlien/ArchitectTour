# Architect Tour

**Architect Tour** is an immersive, self-contained Unity experience that invites you to explore a haunting murder scene through in-game security cameras. You don’t play a character, you *are* the cameras, silently witnessing the eerie aftermath inside a mysterious house.

## Why I Made This

Built as part of Unity’s Creative Core course, this project is my deep dive into world-building and atmosphere. The course provided assets, but I went full throttle customizing animations, soundscapes, VFX, and code to craft a chilling, silent story told through environment and perspective.

## What to Expect
